### _A Decentralized-Rating-System_


Meta Basket is an online store which has a Decentralized,
Blockchain Based, Secured and Trusted Rating System.

### _Why do we require a decentralized rating system ?_
- Current rating systems are centralized having a complete 
  control over the ratings database.
- Central authorities can edit / delete negative ratings to avoid their defamation.
- It can led to huge rating scams with a purpose to attract buyers.


### _How Blockchain will solve this problem ?_

- A Blockchain network is a decentralized, distributed ledger which 
  has rigorous Cryptographic concepts, Consensus mechanisms which 
  makes it reliable, trustworthy and impossible to hack.
- Any thing written in blockchain canâ€™t be removed unless done legally, making rating systems consumer friendly.
- It will also ensure that our system doesn't have single point of faliure.
